This C++ program simulates an animal database and implements a search feature.


I completed this project for my Object-Oriented Programming class this semester
at Uni. It now serves as a base of my understanding of C++ and I am publishing
it into the world in hopes of recieving constructive criticism in regards to 
adding and implementing new methods/concepts as I learn them in the future.

Please be kind as you review my code.
